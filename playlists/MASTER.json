(You've been cheating on me\nI've been cheating through)\n\nBaby, I know death probably hasn't happened yet\n'Cause I don't remember living life before this\nAnd darling, our disease is the same one as the trees\nUnaware that they've been living in a forest\n\nYou've been cheating on, cheating on me\nI've been cheating on, cheating on you\nYou've been cheating on me\nBut I've been cheating through this life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me\nI've been cheating on, cheating on you)\nAnd all its suffering (You've been cheating on me\nI've been cheating through)\nOh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me\nI've been cheating on, cheating on you)\nAm I good for nothing?
